# Zerly - Reverse Charisma Conversation Trainer

## Overview

Zerly is an AI-powered conversation training app designed to help users develop "reverse charisma"—the skill of making others feel valued and engaged in conversations. Users interact with AI-generated characters in realistic social scenarios, receiving real-time feedback and scoring on their conversational effectiveness.

## Features
